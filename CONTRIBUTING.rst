Submitting patches
==================

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this project!

Please **do not** submit a pull request on GitHub.  This repository is
an automated mirror, and I don't develop using GitHub's platform.

Instead, either

- publish a branch somewhere (a GitHub fork is fine), and e-mail
  <spwhitton@spwhitton.name> asking me to merge your branch, possibly
  using git-request-pull(1)

- prepare patches with git-format-patch(1), and send them to
  <spwhitton@spwhitton.name>, possibly using git-send-email(1)

Signing off your commits
========================

You must certify the contents of ``DEVELOPER-CERTIFICATE`` for your
contribution.  Add a ``Signed-off-by`` line to your commit message by
passing the ``-s`` option to git-commit(1).
